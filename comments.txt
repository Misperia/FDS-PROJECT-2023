The statement "the more votes a film has, the higher the ranked position of the film" indicates a positive correlation between the number of votes and the ranked position of a film. This means that as the number of votes increases, the ranked position of the film tends to increase as well.

This observation is common in many rating systems where the ranking is determined by user votes or ratings. A film that has more votes has been seen and rated by more people, which increases the statistical significance of the ranking. As a result, films that are popular and widely viewed tend to have higher ranked positions than those that are less popular.

However, it is important to note that this relationship does not necessarily imply that a film with a high number of votes is inherently better than one with a lower number of votes. It is possible for a lesser-known film to have a high ranking if it is highly rated by a smaller group of viewers. Additionally, other factors such as the timing of the film's release, marketing, and critical acclaim can also influence the number of votes and the ranked position of a film.
